# `CatNav2`

A planning and control system for [CrossWing Nav2](http://crosswing.com/nav2/) robots based on a category theoretical model of systems and software.

***Warning:*** *this is early work with legacy code being gradually redeveoped to fit the category theoretical model with unit tests being built around it. Nothing is efficient, nothing is optimised and a lot things are stupid. This will change.*


## Dependencies:
 * CMake
 * [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) (unit testing)
